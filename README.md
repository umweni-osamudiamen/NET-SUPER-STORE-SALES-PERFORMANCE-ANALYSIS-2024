CONCLUSION:
From the analysis insights, Net-super Store generated a total $5019265.23 for 2024 and it can be concluded that clothing was the main selling product and most customers pays through credit card. Several limitations were discovered like no data on the exact type of food product, furniture, and others, no logistics information, data set was limited to one year so no proper trend was discovered.
Highly unexpected to see clothing top food in sales when much expectation for food to top being the major need of human.
